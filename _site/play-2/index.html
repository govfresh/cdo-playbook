                <p>Effective data management enables data sharing and access across the enterprise which can eliminate data redundancies and lead to overall improved data quality and provide better services. Additionally, data analytics and emerging technologies are dependent on having strong and acceptable data management functions in place, so you have quality data with which to work. The CDO role is to break down organizational silos to foster better transparency and collaboration into the data needed to succeed in transformation projects.</p>

<h2 id="key-strategic-actions">Key strategic actions</h2>

<p>2.1 Collaborate with your CIO Office, statistical official, and evaluation officer (if present in your agency) to understand the history of your agency’s data and infrastructure maturity.</p>

<p>2.2 Identify a strategy to optimally organize and assign data stewards across the enterprise.</p>

<p>2.3 Provide opportunities to train and empower data stewards to be effective in their role.</p>

<p>2.4 Establish an automated means to manage stewardship responsibilities.</p>

<p>2.5 Collaborate with data stewards to develop data lifecycle management best practices. The OPEN Government Data Act mandates that CDOs establish data management best practices to improve the quality of agency data.</p>

<p>2.6 Determine how your data management program will be organized. The data management domains of your program will serve as inputs to your data management strategy (see next step).</p>

<p>2.7 Develop a data management strategy in collaboration with your CIO, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Enterprise Architect or Chief Data Architect, and agency leadership, based on the findings and inputs from earlier action steps. A data management strategy will help you think through how to prioritize investments and resource allocations (e.g., data analytics, data infrastructure).</p>

<p>2.8 Develop an Organizational Change Management (OCM) plan to support your data management strategy. Integrating change management strategies can successfully persuade stakeholders to implement or adjust data management methods or practices.</p>

<p>2.9 Prioritize data sharing projects that generate measurable business outcomes and align with strategic objectives. Using an incremental approach to data management not only delivers benefits to impacted business stakeholders but it also helps you gain quick wins.</p>

<p>2.10 Collaborate with data stewards to develop common business language, such as data term definitions for metadata. Managing metadata vocabularies, formats, and standards ensures a common understanding across the agency of data meaning and its uses.</p>

<p>2.11 Identify data consolidation opportunities across database systems including data sharing and access between business lines. Evaluating data management and analytics capabilities can help you identify open source or shared service opportunities across systems to improve cost efficiency.</p>

<p>2.12 Design a conceptual target data architecture and enterprise solution for databases and other data platforms creating an environment to establish formal data standards. Establishing a target data architecture brings your strategy and the technology side together to show the relationships between your agency’s data functions, technologies, and types.</p>

<p>2.13 Begin data aggregation activities for data consolidation, integration, and service projects. This action ensures you have compiled and processed all the data from different databases needed for your data projects.</p>

<p>2.14 Define and track performance metrics across your data management program functions and monitor overall progress toward them. The information collected provides feedback and inputs into your data management strategy.</p>

<p>2.15 Routinely assess all agency data management tools and technologies (e.g., data analytics capabilities) including Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for efficiencies. With the evolution of data tools, it is important to constantly evaluate your existing resources to determine where cost savings opportunities are.</p>
