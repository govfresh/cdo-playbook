I"{g<p>Focus on mission value creation and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to develop a modern data and analytics strategy that delivers tangible outcomes and value in the immediate and long-term while accounting for organizational, cultural, and technical constraints. A holistic data and analytics strategy also properly plans for budget and resource allocations for mission critical needs. Connecting mission value to your data specific investments and identifying resources that will allow your organization to maximize data for decision making and mission enabling purposes, will help move your organization forward even with a limited budget. Make sure your agency’s data and analytics strategy is more than just complementary to your agency’s mission and enterprise-wide business strategy. Your data strategy should focus on how to transform the organization and in turn influence and transform your mission objectives and business strategy.</p>
