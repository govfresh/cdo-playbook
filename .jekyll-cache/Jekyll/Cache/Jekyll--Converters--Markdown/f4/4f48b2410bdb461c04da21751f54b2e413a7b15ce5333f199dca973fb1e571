I"'C<p>Invest in the individuals within your workforce to create a data-driven culture by improving data literacy and skills. Focus on providing an inclusive approach to building and harnessing basic data skills, knowledge, and competencies in all staff and leadership. Additionally, part of your OCM plan should include strategies for transforming the overall agency culture by getting your workforce to understand the mission value that data can deliver.</p>

<h2 id="key-strategic-actions">Key strategic actions</h2>

<p>3.1	Conduct a landscape analysis to document existing training requirements and identify available training opportunities within your agency and across the federal government that your agency may be able to utilize. Consult the Federal Data Strategy’s Curated Data Skills Catalog in this process. Use existing training resources as a cost-effective approach to training implementation and to leverage potential shared service opportunities across the federal government.</p>

<p>3.2 Build an education and awareness campaign that focuses on communicating the importance and value of data throughout the organization while promoting data literacy. This OCM activity demonstrates your ability to be a change agent, influencing your agency data culture.</p>

<p>3.3 Review or update your workforce skills assessment to understand the coverage, quality, methods, and effectiveness of current staff data literacy and data skills. This step identifies where existing gaps in data literacy and specific data skills are and where additional training might be needed.</p>

<p>3.4 Collaborate with key stakeholder groups, including your HR Office, to create a list of key data skills that are pertinent to your agency’s success. Use this list to develop a training plan that prioritizes these key data skills and links these efforts to your mission goals and objectives.</p>

<p>3.5 Connect with your HR office to develop a training roadmap that includes current and future training needs.</p>

<p>3.6 Determine the resources needed to implement your training and submit a budget request for those needs (e.g., training instructors or training software).</p>

<p>3.7 Consider the type of implementation that works best for your agency, whether that is a pilot program or a comprehensive training program. </p>

<p>3.8 Develop a communications plan to deliver strategic messages to your workforce about your planned data literacy initiatives.</p>

<p>3.9	Coordinate with your agency CHCO and agency CIO to determine crossovers in data and information-focused positions.</p>

<p>3.10 Engage with stakeholder groups to learn about previous and current data and information technology-related hiring needs and plans across agency offices. Understanding your agency’s hiring, attrition, and turnover trends will help in identifying effective strategies and approaches for future hiring plans.</p>

<p>3.11 Develop a hiring plan for future roles needed to fill skill gaps for your organization or carry out CDO mandates and Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB) requirements.</p>

<p>3.12 Assess and measure the mission value gained from data literacy efforts.</p>
