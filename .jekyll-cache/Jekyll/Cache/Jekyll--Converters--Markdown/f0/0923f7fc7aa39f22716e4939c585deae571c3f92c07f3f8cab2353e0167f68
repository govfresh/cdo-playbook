I"≤<p>The CDO Council‚Äôs Data Skills Working Group (WG) created this playbook of four key ‚Äúplays‚Äù which draws from successful practices in both industry and government. It is advice from CDOs to other CDOs, hence you will notice the informal tone and admonitions of what ‚Äòyou‚Äô should consider. It leverages and cites concrete examples from federal CDOs on how they have applied specific strategies and approaches to make progress in each Play to deliver value in this evolving role as a change management leader.</p>
